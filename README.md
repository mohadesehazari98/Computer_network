we can create a simple chatroom using python 

here we need two ends 

One is client end

And the other is server part 

in this project we are using socket programming for transferring data from client to server 

you can have different clients and the ID and messages of each client will be send to the server

Other detailes about Socket programming with comment in each line is available in chatroom file

Enjoy your chatroom ;)
